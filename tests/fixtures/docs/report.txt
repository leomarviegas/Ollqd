Quarterly Engineering Report - Q4 2025
=======================================

Executive Summary
-----------------
The engineering team delivered three major features this quarter:
vector search improvements, PII masking, and SMB file integration.
Overall system uptime was 99.7% with zero critical incidents.

Performance Metrics
-------------------
Average query latency: 45ms (p50), 120ms (p99)
Indexing throughput: 1,200 documents per minute
Embedding generation: 850 vectors per second at batch size 32
Storage efficiency improved by 23% after implementing deduplication.

Architecture Decisions
----------------------
We adopted gRPC for internal service communication between the
Go gateway and Python worker. This replaced the previous REST-based
approach and reduced latency by 40% for streaming operations.

The PII masking pipeline was redesigned to operate at the token
level, enabling real-time unmasking during chat response streaming.

Known Issues
------------
1. Large PDF files (>50MB) may timeout during OCR processing
2. SMB connections occasionally drop on unstable networks
3. t-SNE visualization is slow for collections over 10,000 vectors

Next Steps
----------
- Implement incremental re-indexing with content hashing
- Add support for additional document formats (EPUB, HTML)
- Improve PII detection accuracy with fine-tuned NER models
